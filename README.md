## üß† Overview

This week deepens your understanding of Java by exploring collections and streams ‚Äî key tools for handling groups of data efficiently. You'll also learn about Java I/O, exception handling, regular expressions, unit testing with JUnit, and modern Java 8 features.

## üìò Topics Covered

### Day 1: Java Generics
- Learn about type safety, creating generic classes and methods in Java.

### Day 2: Collections
- Explore the Java Collections Framework: Lists, Sets, Maps, and Queues.

### Day 3: Java IO Streams
- Understand how to handle input and output streams for file operations.

### Day 4: Exceptions
- Master exception handling with try-catch blocks and custom exceptions.

### Day 5: Regex & JUnit
- Use Regular Expressions and write unit tests with the JUnit framework.

### Day 6: Java 8 Features
- Get introduced to Lambda expressions, Stream API, and functional programming.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Completion of Weeks 1-3 Java basics and data structures.
- A computer with a supported operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 17+ recommended).
- A code editor or IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.
- Basic knowledge of compiling and running Java programs.
